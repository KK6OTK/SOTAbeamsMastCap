# SOTAbeamsMastCap

These are some parts for 3D printing to help with putting up antenna wire on a telescopic fiberglass antenna mast. I used the SOTAbeams travel mast (https://www.sotabeams.co.uk/compact-light-weight-10-m-32-ft-travel-mast/). 
Projects were done in FreeCAD.

Parts
------
Antenna Mast Cap - The main part which goes at the top of the mast. The inside is tapered so it should stay on with friction. There's a small loop for attaching the antenna wire.

Antenna Mast Wire Guide - Optional mast ring with an additional hole for running a thin wire antenna through and helps keep it straight and prevent wind from blowing it around.

Antenna Mast Guy Ring - Optional guy ring for 3 or 4 guy lines. It also has a small round cutout next to the hole where the mast sits; this is for running your thin wire straight down the mast and not having the wind blow it around so much, similar to the wire guide mentioned above. Intended for end-fed antennas, but use how you want.
